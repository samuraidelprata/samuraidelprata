👋 Hi, I’m @samuraidelprata ou Cleitin
👀 I’m interested in system development, logistics management, and technology.
🌱 I’m currently learning Systems Development at Senac Minas Gerais.
👨🏾‍💻 I have solid experience in logistics, with a technical background and expertise in stock management, inventory, reporting, and shipping processes. In the IT field, I've developed skills in Excel, Office, and Google Workspace, as well as software troubleshooting. I work with programming languages such as React.js and JavaScript for Frontend, and Java, Spring Boot, IntelliJ, and NetBeans for Backend. I also have knowledge of relational databases like MySQL and SQL Server.
🌐 I’m looking to collaborate on software development and logistics technology projects.
