About Me:

👀 I’m passionate about system development, logistics management, and technology. Currently, I’m on a journey to bridge these fields with innovative solutions.

🌱 I’m studying Systems Development at Senac Minas Gerais, Brazil, where I'm expanding my knowledge in both frontend and backend technologies.

👨🏾‍💻 My background includes solid experience in logistics, with technical expertise in stock control, inventory management, reporting, and shipping operations. Alongside this, I have developed strong skills in IT, particularly in Excel, Office, and Google Workspace, and I’m adept at troubleshooting software issues. On the frontend, I work with React.js and JavaScript, and on the backend, I utilize Java, Spring Boot, IntelliJ, and NetBeans. I also have a good understanding of relational databases like MySQL and SQL Server.

🌐 I’m looking to collaborate on software development and logistics technology projects.
