About Me:

👀 I’m passionate about system development, logistics management, and technology. Currently, I’m on a journey to bridge these fields with innovative solutions.

🌱 I’m studying Systems Development at Senac Minas Gerais, Brazil, where I'm expanding my knowledge in both frontend and backend technologies.

👨🏾‍💻 I bring solid experience in logistics, with a technical background in stock management, inventory control, reporting, and shipping processes. On the IT side, I've developed strong skills in Excel, Office, and Google Workspace, along with expertise in software troubleshooting. I also work with programming languages like React.js and JavaScript for frontend development, and Java, Spring Boot, IntelliJ, and NetBeans for backend development. I have a growing interest in UX/UI design and database management, particularly with relational databases such as MySQL and SQL Server.

🌐 looking to collaborate on software development and logistics technology projects.
